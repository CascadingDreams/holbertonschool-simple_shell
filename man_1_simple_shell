.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple command line interpreter that executes commands read from standard input.
It is intended to be compatible with the most basic functions of the standard shell \fBsh\fR.
.SH INVOCATION
.B simple_shell
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
.PP
When invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, the shell reads commands from standard input.
It displays the prompt \fB#cisfun$\fR when it is ready to read a command.
.PP
When invoked without a terminal connected to standard input, the shell executes received commands in order.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments,
the following actions are taken:
.PP
The command is executed with its arguments in a separate process using the \fBfork\fR and \fBexecve\fR system calls.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B simple_shell
uses the same environment list that was populated at program startup.
When a program is executed, the environment is passed to the new program.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the shell is the exit status of the last command executed.
If no command is executed, the exit status is 0.
.SH SIGNALS
